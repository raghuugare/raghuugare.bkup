Hi dear Friend! :~)

Welcome to my little site, where I would like to discuss and 'share' little nuggets of beauty or lessons that I learned about and/or 'experienced' during my on-going journey to know more about the Art & Science of Programming in particular.

Occasionally, it might contain my ramblings on some other topics too.

### Why call this _"biscuits in tea"_ (b.i.t.) ?

A "bit"---pun intended---of explanation about the name is in order.

+ The name happens to form the _[acronym][link_acronym_meaning]{:target="_blank"}_ of `"BiT"`---the smallest unit of storage in Computer-Science. It mirrors my belief that the tiniest spark of an idea or intuition or inspiration can move us to action. I also wanted this to be a collection of several such interesting tid-**bit**s of fun & learning!

+ **"Biscuits in Tea"**: Well, you can read more about the reasoning for it **[here]({{site.url}}/about){:target="_blank"}**.

I sincerely hope you enjoy 'savouring' these biscuits, nay, anecdotes(or letters rather!) as much as I do [b/m]aking them!

Take care, and Keep smiling! :)

**Love & Best wishes...**
