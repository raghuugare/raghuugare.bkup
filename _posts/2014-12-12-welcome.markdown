Hi dear Friend! :~)

Welcome to my little site, where I would like to discuss and 'share' little nuggets of beauty or lessons that I learned about and/or 'experienced' during my on-going journey to know more about the Art & Science of Programming in particular.

Occasionally, it might contain my ramblings on some other topics too.

### About the name

+ **"Biscuits in Tea"**: You can read about the reasoning for it **[here]({{site.url}}/about)**.
+ The above name also happens to form the _[acronym][link_acronym_meaning]_ of `"BiT"`---the smallest unit of storage in Computer-Science. It mirrors my belief that the tiniest spark of an idea or intuition or inspiration can move us to action. I also wanted this to be a collection of several such interesting tid-**bit**s of fun & learning!

I sincerely hope you enjoy 'savouring' these anecdotes(or letters rather!) as much as I do creating them! :)

Take care, and Keep smiling! :)

**Love & West wishes...**
