# The Joy of Emacs

Right from my introduction to the 'nix world, & its amazing array of tools, I've been an Emacs person, somehow drawn towards its idiosyncrasies. But sadly enough, I got drawn into the world of the different IDE's since I was mostly working on the SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) paradigm and its associated technologies like BPEL, ESB's, Intergation tools like Mule, etc., where IDE's from the likes of IBM, Oracle, and also Eclipse & Jetbrains Intellij ruled the roost because of their close links with the underlying technologies.

However, the programmer inside me always craved to be set free, yearning to churn pure, simple, magical code in Emacs. In recent times, thanks to my stint in a start-up where we got back to programming in Javascript (Node.JS, Meteor JS, Angular, HTML, CSS, etc.), I got a chance to reconcile with my past 'love' ! ;-)

And now, as part of my plunge into the magical world of Functional Programming, with LISP, Scheme, & Haskell, my Love & Appreciation for the Emacs environment (ok, we can ALSO label it an editor, but I feel 'Productivity Environment' does more justice to its capabilities!) has grown manifold.

I see MANY things pioneered in Emacs (as well as Vi & its clones like Vim) resurfacing these days, including the emphasis on extensibility & an almost infinite level of customizability.

As part of my exercise of finally grokking the emacs system & coming up with my own configuration based on inspirations from several 'gurus', I've started a repo on Github called [_rags\_dot\_emacs_](https://github.com/raghuugare/rags_dot_emacs). In it, I'm trying to come up with a decent (& as far as possible, 'recent' as well! ;-)) Emacs configuration to help me in my interests of Haskell, LISP, TeX & LaTeX, Markdown, etc.

Hope you like this ??

Please let me know...

Thanks & Best wishes,

'raghu'
