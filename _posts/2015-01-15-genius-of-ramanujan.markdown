### A glimpse of the great Indian mathe-magician’s work...

History has seldom seen a person who was so passionate, unorthodox, as well as gifted in a field, as was [Srinivasa Ramanujan][link_Ramanujan], the self-taught Indian genius, who made several startling discoveries in the realm of Mathematics.

Despite abject poverty and lack of formal training and encouragement, Ramanujan’s love for numbers never waned. And thanks to a chance encounter and ensuing collaboration with [G.H.Hardy][link_G_H_Hardy] of Cambridge, one of the most eminent mathematicians of the world, his hidden genius came to light.

Ramanujan went on to make thousands of discoveries with the apparent ease of experiencing and recording a series of religious epiphanies by a mystic in a trance. The methods he followed are still shrouded in a veil of mystery, since he usually skipped the formal rigour (and hence made mistakes too sometimes) and relied more on leaps of intuition to arrive at sudden, surprising results.

The several ‘Notebooks’ left behind by Ramanujan are strewn with cryptic formulae and equations, and are still being mined by mathematicians all over the world for beautiful gems and nuggets.

His life, tragically brief though it was, goes to prove the adage:

> TALENT does what it CAN, but **GENIUS** does what it MUST.

Here, we consider a few samples of his work that are accessible (and hence inspiring?) to people who are familiar with basic high-school mathematics.
