## Hello! Tea, anyone ? &#9786;

## ![icon_kettle]({{site.url}}/assets/icons/rags_icon_128_by_128_kettle.png) ---> ![icon_cup]({{site.url}}/assets/icons/rags_icon_128_by_128_cup.png)

Well, well, well!

This has been **brewing** in _the kettle of my heart/mind_ since long...


And the time has finally come to _**serve**_ [^1] it!

[^1]: _"serve"_ on the web, of course! :)

`Confession:` I am an _ardent_ lover of **[Tea][link_tea]{:target="_blank"}**---a fact my friends all over the world can vouch for.

(No offence meant; you are free to substitute Tea with **[Coffee][link_coffee]{:target="_blank"}** or whatever beverage (or activity!) that you love with the same _connotation_. My dear friend **[Vijay][link_vijay]{:target="_blank"}** would definitely go for Coffee, while my dear wife Rajeshwari would clearly choose fresh fruit-juice!)

And _dunking_ [^2] [biscuits][link_biscuit]{:target="_blank"} in piping hot-tea is such a **['Zen'][link_zen]{:target="_blank"}**-experience in itself! :)

[^2]: Yes, ['dunk'][link_dunk_meaning]{:target="_blank"} rather than just 'dip'. Look it up by clicking on the word. :)

Just a tiny _cup o' tea_ makes me

+ ...feel "i" cease to exist for the duration of sipping it (I only realize it later!)...

+ ...get "LOST" in a trance of THOUGHT-LeSS-ness, and NO-MIND-ness,

+ ...move to a state of EMPTY-ness & _joy-filled_ ALONE-ness despite being in the company of my loved & loving ones,

+ ...feel a strange kind of WARMTH & BLiSS that is, to put it in my way, PRiCE-Le$$ ! :)

> To "FIND" (out) Something beautiful, we need to get "LOST" sometimes!

**Don't you agree ? :)**

Well, when I am in [India][link_India]{:target="_blank"}---both in my native village as well as in [Bangalore][link_bangalore]{:target="_blank"}, it is usually hot tea(with milk) laced with aromatic _[Lemon-Grass][link_lemon_grass]{:target="_blank"},_ accompanied by _melt-in-the-mouth_ goodness of **[Parle-G][link_parle_g]{:target="_blank"}** biscuits! &hearts; :)

And when I was in the UK, thanks to my loving friends, it was tea with the classic **[Mc-Vities][link_mc_vities]{:target="_blank"}** Digestives:

## But, it's not just about Biscuits and Tea!

## ![icon_cup]({{site.url}}/assets/icons/rags_icon_128_by_128_cup.png) + ![icon_computer]({{site.url}}/assets/icons/rags_icon_128_by_128_computer.png) + ![icon_ink_pen]({{site.url}}/assets/icons/rags_icon_128_by_128_ink_pen.png) = ![icon_smile]({{site.url}}/assets/icons/rags_icon_128_by_128_smile.png)

Through this site,

+ I want to share some stories/experiences that are as 'beautiful' & 'en-lightening' as are moments of dipping into your favourite book with a cup of hot tea and snacks during chilly mornings or drizzly late-noons & evenings. :)

+ I want to share my little _"EUREKA!", "AHA!",_ and even the _"WTF!"_ moments (the last being especially _ubiquitous_ these days in software); the _epiphanies,_ along with (m)any other learnings connected to Computers or otherwise through this blog.

'Feeling' the presence of a beautiful poem, story, equation, program, function, algorithm, song, pattern, or an image gives me the same kind of 'kick' that a cup of hot tea does! :)

And hence the parallel with tea.

## And me...?

Oh, by the way, I am **Raghu Ugaré** --- a passionate programmer, and an avid Art, Science & Math student for life.

I love to play with _IDEAS, PATTERNS, WORDS_ & _SYMBOLS_ (not realizing that it might be the other way round ?!?).[^3]

[^3]: Sometimes, I do wonder: <br/> "Does our **Mind** manipulate _IDEAS, PATTERNS, WORDS & SYMBOLS_ or is it in fact, manipulated/shaped by them?"

I love ALL kinds of patterns be it in Nature, Philosophy, Religion, Science, Mathematics, Painting, Prose, Poetry, Music, Programming, etc., and the mysterious _connections and unity_ underneath them all.

I love typography and am a font-fanatic.[^4]

[^4]: You will no doubt be witness to a constant 'flux' of changes in the typefaces (fonts) on this site as I keep experimenting!

I love to build simple models from which I try to 'mine' & 'glean' useful data & insights.

Above all, I love to SHARE my discoveries with my dear friends! :)

I am indeed incredibly blessed to have come into the contact of some truly great _gurus_ & brilliant friends from diverse fields, & I want to share all that I can possibly recollect & deem worthy of sharing that I learnt from them, directly or otherwise.

Please keep reading these free-flowing 'letters' to YOU --- I hope they make you smile, for a while! :)

Do visit my [personal blog][link_personal_blog]{:target="_blank"} for thoughts on other topics...

Recently, I also wrote an article on **Medium** about [the Genius of Sreenivasa Ramanujan][link_medium_story_ramanujan]{:target="_blank"}.

Have a wonder-filled time with your dear ones!

**Love & Best Wishes,**
