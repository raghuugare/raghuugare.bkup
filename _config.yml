  A collection of writings with which I want to share my discoveries of little gems & nuggets related to Computer Science and Programming in particular, and some other topics in general. The writings could be specific to a some programming language, or be about a more general concept like Algorithms or Data-structures.
  Thanks to all the great Gurus & Pioneers of Computer Science, and Mathematics on whose shoulders we're able to see far far more...
