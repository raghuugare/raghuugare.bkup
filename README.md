# Introduction

Random ramblings ranging from programming to artificial intelligence; from philosophy to art & math; from poetry to physics, from artificial intelligence to human ignorance...

This is my collection of miscellaneous nuggets - revived & resurrected every now and then.

Patterns of all kinds interest & intrigue me.

Currently, I'm also into Functional Programming (using Haskell), Math, & Machine Learning.
